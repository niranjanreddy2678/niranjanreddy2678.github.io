    "     SPACY : Unlike NLTK, which is widely used for teaching and research, spaCy focuses on providing software for production usage. spaCy also supports deep learning workflow that allow connecting statistical models trained by popular machine learning libraries like Tensorflow, PyTorch through its own machine learning library Thinc. Using Thinc as its backend, spaCy features convolution neural network models for speed of tagging, dependency parsing, text categorization and named entity recognition (NER). Prebuilt statistical  models to perform these task are available for English, German, Greek, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Dutch, Lithuanian and Norwegian, and there is also a multi-language NER model. Additional support for tokenization for more than 50 languages allows users to train custom models on their own datasets as well. "

In the collaborative filtering, it gives idea of having the internal communication between the two drones or two sets. Even the collaborative filtering may act as an antigen to an immune network which helps in communicating it with the other drones by the secure channel. This is the ongoing research and many experiments are yet to be performed. Most of the systems had adopted biological behavior in the architecture-based computing which is used in the traditional days in which certain numbers of tasks execute in parallel where there is no centralized system control. Lot of researchers have started computing the fitness levels of various computing techniques for determining unique features of AIS while trying to adopt to old computing architecture and few of them consider that applying these algorithms practically would really solve the real-world problems. In this paper the author conveyed the efficiency of handling datasets which contains real time data can be improved more by bringing out the most invaluable or hidden features of the architectures. \"\"\""

It also supports named entities for multi language. NLTK is a string processing library. It takes strings as input and returns strings or lists of strings as output. Whereas, spaCy uses object-oriented approach. When we parse a text, spaCy returns document object whose words and sentences are objects themselves."
